# UtilBlox

UtilBlox is an open-source utility that builds upon the now-deprecated project, **RobloxIdleTerminator**. While RobloxIdleTerminator was already perfect in its functionality of monitoring Roblox for 20.5 minutes of inactivity and terminating it, UtilBlox introduces additional features for enhanced usability and flexibility.

## Key Features
- **Trigger-Key Solution**: Allows users to define a trigger key (e.g., `G`) to spam a target key (e.g., `F`) efficiently.
- **Debouncing Mechanism**: Prevents multiple hold sessions and infinite loops caused by system key repeats.
- **GUI Optimization**: A sleek and compact interface for better usability.
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logs for debugging and performance tracking (for developers).

## Why UtilBlox?
UtilBlox aims to add new features to extend its functionality. The core idea of RobloxIdleTerminator remains intact and unchanged.
